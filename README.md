# Express Form Submission with Validation and Image Upload 📝🖼️


# Project Overview 🚀

This project is a simple web application built with Node.js and Express.js that allows users to submit a form with their name, email, and an image. The submitted form data is validated on the server-side, and upon successful validation, the submitted information is displayed on a separate page along with the uploaded image.

## Features ✨

- **Form Submission:** Users can submit their name, email, and an image through a form.
- **Server-side Validation:** The submitted form data is validated on the server-side to ensure the correctness of the input.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image along with their form submission.
- **Error Handling:** If there are validation errors, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** The submitted form data is dynamically rendered on a separate page upon successful submission.

# Code Concepts 🛠️

- **Express.js Middleware:** Utilizing various middleware such as `body-parser`, `multer`, and `express-validator` for handling form data parsing, file uploads, and form validation.
- **Template Rendering:** Using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to dynamically generate HTML content with server-side data.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling middleware to handle validation errors and display them to the user.
- **Static File Serving:** Serving static files (CSS, images) using Express.js's built-in static middleware.
